# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis** repository! This repository is dedicated to understanding the crucial phase of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). By the end of this repository, you'll have a thorough understanding of its importance, the activities involved, and how it applies to real-world projects like a booking management system.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a systematic process of gathering, analyzing, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It serves as the foundation for designing and building solutions that meet business objectives.

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC:
- **Understanding Project Scope**: Defines clear objectives and boundaries for the software project.
- **Enhancing Communication**: Bridges the gap between stakeholders and developers.
- **Reducing Errors**: Identifies and mitigates potential risks early in the project lifecycle.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
1. **Ensures Alignment with Stakeholder Goals**: Aligns software functionality with business objectives to deliver value to stakeholders.
2. **Minimizes Development Costs**: Early identification of requirements reduces costly changes and rework during later stages.
3. **Improves Project Success Rates**: Helps prevent project failure by ensuring all critical requirements are captured and understood.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
1. **Requirement Gathering**:
   - Identify stakeholders.
   - Collect requirements through interviews, surveys, and workshops.

2. **Requirement Elicitation**:
   - Actively engage with stakeholders to uncover their explicit and implicit needs.

3. **Requirement Documentation**:
   - Record and structure requirements in clear, concise documents or specifications.

4. **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**:
   - Analyze collected requirements for feasibility, consistency, and completeness.
   - Use tools like flowcharts, ER diagrams, or use case diagrams for visual representation.

5. **Requirement Validation**:
   - Review requirements with stakeholders to ensure they align with business goals and constraints.

## Types of Requirements
### Functional Requirements
Define specific behaviors or functions the system must perform.

#### Examples for a Booking Management System:
- Users must be able to search properties by location, price, and availability.
- Users should be able to book a property and receive a booking confirmation via email.
- The system must allow administrators to add, edit, and delete property listings.

### Non-functional Requirements
Define system attributes like performance, security, and usability.

#### Examples for a Booking Management System:
- The system should handle up to 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation.
- User data must be encrypted during transmission and at rest.
- Pages should load within 2 seconds on average under normal conditions.

## Use Case Diagrams
### What are Use Case Diagrams?
Use case diagrams visually represent the interactions between actors (users or systems) and the functionalities (use cases) of a system. They help clarify system scope and stakeholder interactions.

#### Benefits:
- Simplifies communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Provides a clear visual representation of system functionality.
- Helps identify and document user requirements effectively.

### Booking Management System Use Case Diagram

## Acceptance Criteria
### Importance of Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance criteria define the conditions that a feature must meet to be considered complete and acceptable by stakeholders. They ensure that development aligns with expectations and provides a clear definition of "done."

### Example: Checkout Feature
#### Acceptance Criteria:
- The user can select a booking date range and confirm the total price before checkout.
- The user must provide valid payment details to complete the transaction.
- Upon successful payment, the system sends a booking confirmation email.
- The checkout process must be completed within 3 steps or fewer.
